Hi there! I'm Daniel, and this page is where I'm hosting a small selection of my projects I feel are robust enough to keep on a portfolio.
This will hopefully grow over time as I either find more backlogged projects I've done or develop new ones.

I'm currently learning ASP.NET and Blazor as I develop an online version of the card game Bulls**t.
My strongest languages by far is C#, but I am also familiar with Java, C/C++, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and a little bit of Python.
I also learned some Prolog as part of a class.

As I continue to develop this profile and learn how to make better READMEs, I hope to make it more visually appealling.
In the meantime, I hope you enjoy viewing my work!
